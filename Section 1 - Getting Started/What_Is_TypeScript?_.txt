What is TypeScript?
    - TypeScript really is just a super set to JavaScript - it offers more features than vanilla JavaScript like classes, interfaces, and very important, types.
    - You define in TypeScript if a certain variable is a number, a string or something else.
    - You can't have a string variable and then to assign a number - that would give us an error - and therefore it allows you to write much more robust code - which gets checked at the time you write it, and not just at the time you run it.
    - However, TypeScript doesn't run in the browser, so it is compiles to JavaScript in the end - this compilation is handled by the CLI.
        - This compilation is very fast, and therefore in the end, in the browser, JavaScript is going to run.
        - We're not writing the Angular app in JavaScript though, because whilst technically possible, that won't be much fun.
            - A lot of the features really only exist in TypeScript, and Angular is meant to be used together with TypeScript.
