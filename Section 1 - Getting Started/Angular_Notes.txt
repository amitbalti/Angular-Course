Angular is not a tool to allow us to write static HTML files.
It allows us to mix static HTML code and dynamic things we want to output in that code.

A component always has a template, the HTML code, possibly has some styling in the css file, and importantly, it has a TypeScript (.ts) file.

Angular is split up into multiple modules - sub-packages you could say. We need to add them if we want to use a certain feature from them.

The app.module.ts file is where we tell Angular which pieces belong to our app.
    - There we have to add something to import another package from Angular.
    - We need to import it at the top of the file first - because TypeScript always needs to know where things are.
    - Then we have in this component the 'imports : [];' section. 
        - This is simply a feature understood by Angular since it's part of an Angular module.
        - Then it tells Angular that we want to import some form features for example.
