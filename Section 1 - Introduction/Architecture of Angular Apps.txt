A lot of modern applications have at least two parts: 
    - Frontend.
        - Also called the client, is the part that runs in a web browser, and this is what the user sees and interacts with.
        - It is essentially includes the UI (User Interface) of an application.
        - We use HTML, CSS, TypeScript and Angular to build the frontend.
    - Backend.
        - The backend sits of a web server, or multiple web servers in the cloud.
        - Is responsible for storing the data and doing any kind of processing.
    
    - Our frontend, or the client app, talks to the backend to get or save the data.

One of the questions that a lot of beginners asks, is how do I save my data in Angular?
    - Well, you don't.
    - In most cases you don't save the data on the client because it can easily disappear as the user clears the browser data, or moves to a different computer.
    - That's why we store the data on the server.

API - Application Programming Interface.

HTTP Services / APIs 
    - Are essentially endpoints that are accessible via the HTTP protocol.
    - So we can call them using simple HTTP requests to get or to save the data.

Our web applications have a frontend, and a backend.
    - On the backend we have one or more databases and APIs that make the data available to the clients.
        - For a large application around a complex domain, this is where we implement the business logic of the application, like calculating the tax and shipping cost based on various parameters.
    - The frontend, or the client on the other hand, is all about the presentation.
        - So here we have our HTML templates as well as the presentation logic of our application.
        - Presentation logic - is all about displaying data and responding to user actions like what should happen when the user clicks on a button or navigates away from a page.

Implementation:
    - In terms of the implementation, building the backend requires familiarity with other languages and frameworks, and that's completely outside the scope of building client apps with Angular.
    - This is the job of a backend developer where a full stack developer who knows both the frontend and the backend.
