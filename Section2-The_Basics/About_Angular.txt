'app-root' is not a default HTML element. Instead, is one of our own components.
The root component of our application, is the component which will tie together our whole application in the end.
All the files in the 'app' folder, which have component in their name, are related to this 'app-root' component. 

In the 'app.component.ts' file, we can see that we have this @Component decorator, but more importantly we see, that we have the 'selector' property, which assigns a string as a value, and this string holds 'app-root'. 
    - This clearly is the same text as in our index.html file, and this actually is the information Angular needed to be able to replace the part in the index.html (<app-root></app-root>) with the template of this component (the component having this selector) and the template of this component, simply is the content here in the 'app.component.html' file. 

How is Angular triggered? How is it kicked off to actually run over our body of this index.html file?
    - In the final index.html file, which is getting served in the browser.

The 'main.ts' file:
    - Here we see that we get a couple of imports, then we check if we are in production mode or not.
    - Most importantly this line: platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
        - This now bootstraps starts our Angular application by passing an AppModule to this method, and app.module refers to the 'app.module.ts' file.
